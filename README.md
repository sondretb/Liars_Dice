# Liars_Dice
To correctly run the app you must use an Android 22 Lollipop API or later.
You'll need two emulators to play the game. (Subject to change if we add a developer mode with fake players)

It is adviced to have Ndm and NodeJs installed.
For windows: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-environment/javascript/nodejs-on-windows
For mac and linux: https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm

1. In Liars_dice/server run "npm install" in the terminal.
2. To Start the server run "npm run start:dev"
3. If the server is running correctly there should be a "listening on 3000" message in the terminal.
4. Start the emulator and vertify that the client joined the server. There should be a message in the terminal that the client joined.
